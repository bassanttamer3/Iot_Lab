# IoT Lab Task

## Task Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and style a form containing at least three input fields. When the form is submitted, the entered data should be added to a list. Ensure that when multiple clients are opened, the list is synchronized and displays the updated data across all clients.

This project uses **Express** to create the web server and **WebSocket** (via the `socket.io` library) for real-time communication between the server and clients.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment on the server-side.
- **Express**: Framework for building web applications with Node.js.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time communication between the server and clients over WebSocket.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating and styling the user interface.

## Prerequisites
